# datascience-bibliography

All the interesting contents I own about data science.

I am starting with the books, will then populate with MOOCs/articles/online resources when I will find time.

If you have any interesting content to recommend, please email at [md dot hadji at gmail dot com](mailto:md.hadji@gmail.com). Thank you !
